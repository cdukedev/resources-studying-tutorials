JavaScript

ARRAYS
any data type can be stored together
Const arrays are mutable

can .push() and .pop()

.shift() removes the first element
.unshift() adds an element to the beginning

Logical Operations
&& for and
|| for or
! for not
== for equality
=== for strict equality

VAR, LET, CONST 
Hoisting is the process of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope

If you are console logging an undefined variable, JavaScript will not throw an error, but it will log undefined and hoist the variable to the top of the scope.
---

let is block scoped - it is not available outside of the block {}

with var you can reassign a variable
such as 
var a = 1;
var a = 2;

or 

var a = 1;
a = 2;

---
with let you cannot reassign a variable
such as
let a = 1;
let a = 2;

only as
let a = 1;
a = 2;

let can be reassigned but not redeclared unless declared outside of the block {}

No Hoisting with let
If you try to console log a let variable that has not been declared, you will get an error

const is block scoped and immutable - it is not available outside of the block {} and cannot be reassigned
